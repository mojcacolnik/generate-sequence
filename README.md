# generate-sequence

A small npm library to easily generate arrays of a chosen length and sequence pattern. Inspired by a codewars kata.

# Installation

```sh
npm i generate-sequence
```

# Usage

```js
const generateSequence = require('generate-sequence')

console.log(generateSequence(3, 'la')) // logs [ 'la', 'la', 'la' ]

console.log(generateSequence(10, (x, index) => index + 1)) // logs [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ]

console.log(generateSequence(6, (x, index) => index % 3)) // logs [ 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2 ]
```
